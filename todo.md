# Todo

* BROWSER: browser-based epub export using bookmaker custom elements.
* Theming.
* Config.
* BROWSER: Customised xml-serialiser. Fork it to create a version that has custom serialisation behaviour for custom elements. Probably using an xmlTagName property.
* DOCX import.
* Link handling for merged documents.
* BROWSER: Use rollup, browserify, and uglify to generate four files: es6 module, cjs module, standalone, standalone minified.
